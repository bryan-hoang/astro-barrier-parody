# Astro Barrier Parody

The game consists of one simple level where the player uses the left and right arrow keys to move a ship and spacebar to shoot bullets at a moving target. The player has an ammo limit of 10 bullets with an additional constraint of a timer. Once either resource runs out before all of the targets are hit, 'Game Over' text pops up. Else, you win and can restart the game back at the start screen.

## Disclaimer
I have not tested the game since demoing it at the competition, so there still may be some bugs.
