# Astro Barrier

A project created during a hackathon. Note: I have not tested the game since demoing it at the competition, so there still may be some bugs.

Notes made while planning:

    Delegating roles:

    - Front-end: UI
    - Back-end: how to accept user input from keyboard
    - Display settings, how to deal with moving objects
    - How to decide if lost/moving onto level
    - Level design
